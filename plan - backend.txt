2. User database

col 2 - array of saved recipe ids, eg [001, 052, 092]

Database calls
When searching:
Option 1 - by text
get from recipe database anything where input matches completely or partially the title

Option 2 - by tag
get from recipe database anything where all input tags are included in the array of database tags

Favouriting/unfav
User clicks favorite button, add ID of corresponding recipe to col 2 array where user id matches
unfavourite -> filter array with recipe id, removing it

Login to web page using database matching password.
Will try to figure out passport, but use JWT if cant.

Delete account
drop from table if user id matches
