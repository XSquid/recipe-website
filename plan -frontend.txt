home page

Button to select a search method? by name (search bar) or tag (select options) - redirect to search page

---
search page (results underneath)
if by name - text box + submit that will search through titles using submitted text
if by tag - maybe a check box for appetizer, lunch, dinner, dessert, all - beef, chicken, pork, vegetable - if dessert is selected, cookie, cake, pie, etc.
 -- I think this would be easier to get a list of all tags from the database, then display them all
after search is submitted, display any matching recipes below.
Recipes will just have the name, and if hovered over show you can click them.
if logged in, have a star button that can add them to your favorites/saved recipes (can unfavourite them as well)

Clicking a recipe will show the detailed recipe:
Title

Have a save button to add to favourites if logged in.

button for changing password, deleting account - maybe have this in a cogwheel drop down
